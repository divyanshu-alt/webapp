Dr. Gautamdas (Rajendra Kumar) is a UK trained doctor who volunteers to go to Japan to help deal with the horror of the radiation aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They meet in Japan and the inevitable happens when hero meets heroine. Lord Bertrand Russell in London  gives Gautam his blessings and best wishes for his travel to Japan. Russell   a pacifist and anti-war thinker (who appears in a cameo role) sets the tone of this 1967 film. On arrival in Japan Dr Gautamdas takes up a role in a hospital where Meloda's father Dr Akhira (Chetan Anand) is director. The storyline takes us through the stark and sometimes gory suffering that radiation victims endured; as a stark reminder of the long term damage caused by atomic weapons. A majority of the shoot sequences are in Japan  with director Mohan Kumar taking artistic liberties in switching from the Ginza strip  with pan shots of the Mitsubishi tower  ...",

Songs (which continue to be banned by the Indian Government) are hilarious too: \"Kiski chali hai kahe gaye baat ye pyare Jhulelalan  jaan bachao  kher manoa  lagega sub ka number  dhama dham mast kalandhar  aaj hai koi baher to kal woh hoga andhar...\"; \"Prabhuji de do ik santann....\"; \"Kya mil gaya Bhagwan  Emergency lagake nasbandi karake hamari chuthi karake  nasbandi karake hamari bansi bajake...\".",

Dinanath thinks she is Hindu and calls her Shanti  and thinks of making her his daughter-in-law  as she nurses him and looks after the entire household after he has an accident. One day Dinanath meets with a blind man who he recognizes as Dr. Varma (Om Shivpuri)  who he has known for many years.
